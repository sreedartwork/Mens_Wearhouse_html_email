# Mens_Wearhouse_html_email
This project was done with the MJML app.  I wanted to test out alternatives to Foundation for emails.
MJML's app was a good resource for doing emails and cutting down the time it would take to code everything by hand.
I also used a web starter kit from the Coding Phase website to watch the files through live-reload and browser-sync.
Lastly, I check the email in Gmail and MailChimp for quality.
